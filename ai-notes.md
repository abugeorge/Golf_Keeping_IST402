# AI Notes

## 🧠 Tools Used
- **ChatGPT (GPT-5)** — primary AI assistant for prototyping, UI/UX advice, and debugging.
- **GitHub Copilot** — minor autocomplete support while editing in VS Code.

## 💬 Key Prompts & How They Were Used

| Date | AI Tool | Prompt | Accepted / Edited |
|------|----------|---------|-------------------|
| Oct 28 | ChatGPT | “Build a mobile-friendly golf scorekeeping web app (1–4 players, auto totals, persistence).” | Accepted base layout with manual refinements to colors, font, and layout. |
| Oct 29 | ChatGPT | “Add end-game button that shows the winner after all scores are filled.” | Accepted most logic; edited alert text and modal layout. |
| Oct 29 | ChatGPT | “Fix overlap of ‘Auto totals’ and ‘Local save’ on mobile.” | Accepted suggested flexbox `.tip-line` class with responsive media query. |
| Oct 29 | ChatGPT | “Prevent zoom on numeric input focus (iOS).” | Accepted both meta tag and `font-size:16px` patch; added note about Safari behavior. |

## ⚙️ Summary of AI-Generated Code
- **Core HTML structure** generated with ChatGPT as a starter.
- **CSS responsiveness** (cards, chips, toolbar) built iteratively through short prompts.
- **JavaScript scoring logic** (undo, reset, localStorage persistence) largely handwritten; AI assisted with small corrections.
- **“End Game” feature** logic generated by ChatGPT with human-verified winner computation.
- **Mobile UI adjustments** (chip stacking, zoom prevention) implemented via ChatGPT-suggested snippets.

---

## ✅ Verification & Human Oversight
- All AI-generated snippets were tested locally in Chrome and on mobile Safari.
- Validation focused on:
  - Proper totals update after undo/clear.
  - Persistence after refresh (localStorage).
  - Responsive rendering on 360px–980px screens.
- No AI output was used without review or modification.

---

## ⚠️ Observed Pitfalls
- AI occasionally produced incorrect selector names or double-defined event listeners.
- ChatGPT initially suggested outdated HTML meta attributes (e.g., `user-scalable=no`), which were corrected manually.
- Over-specific CSS (fixed widths) required cleanup for mobile layouts.

---

## 🔍 Reflection
AI assistance accelerated development (especially layout & interactivity) by about **60–70%**, but still required manual:
- Accessibility review (contrast, touch targets).
- Mobile visual fine-tuning.
- Testing on iOS/Android browsers.
- Troubleshooting and implementing fixes

While Chat defiantly helped greatly with coding the apps and its features. It still at times needed to be adjusted. For example on the phone the app would, zoom in constantly on the number which it helped me. It also helped me to add in new ideas, like being able to finish the game and declare the winner.
